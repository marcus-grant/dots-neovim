# Neovim Dotfiles

NeoVIm is my go to IDE, yes IDE not text editor. For quick and dirty editing of text 

## Versions

This is now my 3rd version of this dotfile set.
Sometimes with dotfiles I like to
start fresh again as I've learned more.
This time I'm focusing more on simplicity.
Lua plugins will be attempted to be made by hand first for
the simplified version of what
I want so this doesn't become a confusing swiss army knife.
It's mostly the complicated stuff like whichkey, autocomplete,
fzf, etc that gets offloaded to plugins or external programs.
This is also the first version to **only** use the new LuaJIT,
so no more vimscript whatsoever, only Lua.

To view the older version,
the final commit of the previous version was:
`24bea0aedf0bc22b0e68afe4ec9a1aa048281979`.
If it's not here in this version of the repository,
then it should exist in the archive version of it.
